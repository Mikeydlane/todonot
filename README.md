# To Do Not

ruby todo cli program that writes todo tasks to a file and has methods to add, delete, etc

## Setup

* a default file named `todo.txt` needs to be created at the root of directory


### Objectives

* Use rubys `File` library to read and write to an external file.
  * when running the program, allow for a file to be provided that will track todo list, and if none provided use a default file.


* Provide a console interface to display todo list.
